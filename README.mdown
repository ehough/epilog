# epilog [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/ehough/epilog.png)](http://travis-ci.org/ehough/epilog)

Fork of [monolog](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog) compatible with PHP 5.2+.

### Motivation

[monolog](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog) is a fantastic logging library, but it's only compatible with PHP 5.3+. While 97% of PHP servers run PHP 5.2 or higher,
**32% of all servers are still running PHP 5.2 or lower** ([source](http://w3techs.com/technologies/details/pl-php/5/all)).
It would be a shame to exempt this library from nearly half of the world's servers just because of a few version incompatibilities.

Once PHP 5.3+ adoption levels near closer to 100%, this library will be retired.

### How to use

```php
<?php

// create a log channel
$log = new ehough_epilog_Logger('name');
$log->pushHandler(new ehough_epilog_handler_StreamHandler('path/to/your.log', ehough_epilog_Logger::WARNING));

// add records to the log
$log->addWarning('Foo');
$log->addError('Bar');
```

### Differences from  [monolog](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog)

The primary difference is naming conventions of monolog's classes. Instead of the `\Monolog` namespace
(and sub-namespaces), instead prefix the class names with `ehough_epilog` and follow the [PEAR
naming convention](http://pear.php.net/manual/en/standards.php).

A few examples of class naming conversions:

    \Monolog\Logger                     ----->    ehough_epilog_Logger
    \Monolog\Handler\StreamHandler      ----->    ehough_epilog_handler_StreamHandler
    \Monolog\Processor\MemoryProcessor  ----->    ehough_epilog_processor_MemoryProcessor

Other "gotchas" when using epilog instead of monolog:

* The [Gelf handler](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog/blob/master/src/Monolog/Handler/GelfHandler.php) can only be used with PHP 5.3+
* The [DoctrineCouchDBHandler](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog/blob/master/src/Monolog/Handler/DoctrineCouchDBHandler.php) can only be used with PHP 5.3+
* The [RedisHandler](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog/blob/master/src/Monolog/Handler/RedisHandler.php) can only be used with PHP 5.3+


### LoggerFactory

epilog also adds a handy class for building `ehough_epilog_Logger` instances: [`ehough_epilog_LoggerFactory`](https://github.com/ehough/epilog/blob/develop/src/main/php/ehough/epilog/LoggerFactory.php). You can use this factory to perform one-liner instantiations:

```php
<?php

$logger = ehough_epilog_LoggerFactory::getLogger('name');
```

Any loggers built this way will share the same stack of handlers and processors, thereby reducing unnecessary memory overhead.

### Releases and Versioning

Releases are synchronized with the upstream monolog repository. e.g. `ehough/epilog 1.6.0` has merged the code
from `Seldaek/monolog 1.6.0`.
